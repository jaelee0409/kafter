# KAfter — Claude Instructions

## Git Conventions

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`
- Keep subject lines under 72 characters
- Commit after each significant feature or set of related changes
- Push to remote when the user asks or after a meaningful milestone
